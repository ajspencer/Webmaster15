                    The members of our chapter are active at NCSSM, inside of the classroom, inside our chapter and in the greater community. Members of our chapter strive to maintain excellent grades, excel in their events in TSA and impact the greater community. Members of our chapter all complete 60 hours of community service the summer of their junior or senior year. In addition to this service, the chapter engages with the community in numerous other ways. Members of our chapter volunteered in a food drive to raise money and food for a local food bank, often volunteer to help in Open Houses and often assist other students with their work. Our officers make it a priority to reinforce the importance of giving to the community.
